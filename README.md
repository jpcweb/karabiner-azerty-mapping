## Getting Started
Karabiner is a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for macOS.

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on your Mac.

### Installation
1. Copy the azerty-map.json into `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` and add this rule in Karabiner-Elements > Complex modifications
<br/>This Remap fixes `keypad suppr, keypad point, Fn, backslash, quote, @#|~{}[]\_!\*-=`
<br/>You can assign it on your specific device in Karabiner-Elements (in case you have many).

> :warning: **It works on a Cooler Master MK750** and I didn't try it with others.
